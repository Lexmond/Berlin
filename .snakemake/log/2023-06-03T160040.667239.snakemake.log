Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule nextalign in file /Users/nic/NIC/Berlin/Snakefile, line 48:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
_nextalign/output/vic/pa/nextalign_gene_PA.translation.fasta
_nextalign/output/vic/pa/nextalign.aligned.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
