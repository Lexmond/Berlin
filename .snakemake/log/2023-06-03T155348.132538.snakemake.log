Waiting at most 30 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule nextalign in file /Users/nic/NIC/Berlin/Snakefile, line 48:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 30 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
_nextalign/output/vic/pa/nextalign_gene_PA.translation.fasta
_nextalign/output/vic/pa/nextalign.aligned.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
